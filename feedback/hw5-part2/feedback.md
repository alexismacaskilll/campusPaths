### Total Score: 9/10
- Problem 1: 7/7

I assume that "space collection" is a misspelling of "space complexity."

- Problem 4: 2/3

Your response is a bit verbose and, in places, delves into unnecessary minutiae.

The below scores are separate:

### Implementation Score: 3/3

Your representation invariant allows an edge to have a destination node not
present in the graph.

Otherwise, everything looks very well done.

### Design Score: 3/3

The ADT operation `listChildren` is named a bit misleadingly, since it actually
observes the set of edges outgoing from a given node.

Otherwise, the ADT design is clean and nicely documented.

### Testing Score: 3/3

Testsuites look thorough and nicely structured.

#### Code Review Feedback
