Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW 3-4 and why
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

- I added a containsEdge and containsNode method to my graph ADT. I added these methods because
for the find Path method, I throw an Illegal Argument Exception if the starting node and/or
ending node is not contained in the graph, so having this method would be useful. I added spec
tests and implementation tests for these new methods.
