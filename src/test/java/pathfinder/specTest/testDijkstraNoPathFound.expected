# Test the Find Path with two valid nodes that have no path in the graph

# Create graph
created graph simpleGraph

# Add nodes to the graph
added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

# Add edges to the graph
added edge 10.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 2.000 from B to C in simpleGraph

# Find shortest path from A to D
path from A to D:
no path found
