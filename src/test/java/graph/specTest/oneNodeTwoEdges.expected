# Tests that a graph can have one node and two edges.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node to the graph
added node n1 to graph1

# Add a self edge to the graph
added edge label1 from n1 to n1 in graph1
# Add a self edge to the graph
added edge label2 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph
graph1 contains: n1
# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(label1) n1(label2)
