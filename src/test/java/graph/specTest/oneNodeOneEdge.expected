# Tests that a graph can have a self-edge, a node who has itself as one of its children

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node to the graph
added node n1 to graph1

# Add a self edge to the graph
added edge label from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(label)
