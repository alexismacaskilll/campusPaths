# Tests creating a two-node complete graph, a graph that has an edge from every vertex to every
# other vertex, and every vertex has self edges.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node to the graph
added node n1 to graph1
# Add a node to the graph
added node n2 to graph1

# Add a self edge to the graph
added edge label1 from n1 to n1 in graph1
# Add an edge to the graph
added edge label2 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Add an edge to the graph
added edge label3 from n2 to n1 in graph1
# Add a self edge to the graph
added edge label4 from n2 to n2 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(label1) n2(label2)
# Print the outgoing edges from n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(label3) n2(label4)
