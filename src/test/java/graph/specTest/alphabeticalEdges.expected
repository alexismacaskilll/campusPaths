# Tests adding edges to a graph in reverse alphabetical order,  first by node name and then in reverse alphabetical order by label, and printing the children out in alphabetical order.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node to the graph
added node n1 to graph1
# Add a node to the graph
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge to the graph
added edge label from n1 to n2 in graph1
# Add an edge to the graph
added edge label1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
# Add a self edge to the graph
added edge label2 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(label2) n2(label) n2(label1)
