# Tests that a single edge can be added to a graph of three nodes.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node to the graph
added node n1 to graph1
# Add a node to the graph
added node n2 to graph1
# Add a node to the graph
added node n3 to graph1

# Add an edge to the graph
added edge label from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(label)
# Print the outgoing edges from n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are:
# Print the outgoing edges from n3
the children of n3 in graph1 are:
