# Tests creating a graph with two edges that do not have identical parent and child nodes, but have
# the same label.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node to the graph
added node n1 to graph1
# Add a node to the graph
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge to the graph
added edge label1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
# Add an edge to the graph
added edge label1 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(label1)
# Print the outgoing edges from n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(label1)
